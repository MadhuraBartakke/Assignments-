<p>
    The actions we take this decade will define the planet's path over the next century.
    We are taking on the dual threats of accelerated climate change and unprecedented biodiversity loss; 
    and maximizing resilience and benefits for our most precious ecosystems and vulnerable communities.
     By letting science guide our focus and equity guide our execution, we can shape a better 2030 for 
     people and our planet.

    Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.
     "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
     The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature,
      human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
